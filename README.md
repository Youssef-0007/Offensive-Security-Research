# Offensive-Security-Research
Breaking Systems. Documenting the Why. Elevating Security.

A collection of high-quality, professionally written offensive security analyses and exploitation write-ups.  
This repository showcases real-world attack methodologies across Web, Crypto, Binary Exploitation, and Secure System Design.

Each analysis is structured like a technical research paper, focusing on:
- Vulnerability discovery
- Attack surface decomposition
- Exploitation strategy and reasoning
- Secure design lessons
- Professional, accessible documentation
